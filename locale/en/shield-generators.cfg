[technology-description]
shield-generators-basics=Research fundamentals of energy shields
shield-generators-turret-shields-basics=Every turret receive it's own energy shield, which protect it from small attacks. Recharge rate is slow, so this shield won't hold for long.
shield-generators-turret-shield-capacity=Increases internal energy shield battery capacity of turrets, allowing energy shields to work for longer under sustained fire or in periouds of blackout.
shield-generators-turret-shield-speed=Increases speed at which turret energy shields recharge, allowing turret to take focused fire for longer periods.
shield-generators-provider-shield-speed=Increases speed at which energy shields generators recharge, allowing protected factories to take focused fire for longer periods.
shield-generators-turret-shield-input=Increases speed at which internal batteries of turret energy shields recharge, allowing energy shield to recharge internal batteries quicker.

shield-generators-provider-shields-basics=Weak energy shield generator which is capable of shielding a small factory from enemy attacks.
shield-generators-generator-advanced=Energy shield generator which is capable of shielding a medium factory from enemy attacks.
shield-generators-generator-elite=Strong energy shield generator which is capable of shielding a large factory from enemy attacks.
shield-generators-generator-ultimate=Ultimate energy shield generator which is capable of shielding a enormous factory from enemy attacks.

shield-generators-superconducting-shields=Allows shields from generators to take more damage before exhausting.
